## New MV Released

A few days ago, Eric Clapton released the MV of the song "Spiral" in the new album "I Still Do".

The MV took Peter Blake's portrait as his starting point and entered one psychedelic vortex.
The whirlpool presents the guitar God is near.
The animation of the classic moments of the 50-year musical career, from the near and far, Eric Clapton's various periods of Icon from the 70-year-old tour back to the Yardbirds period.
The entire MV is a review of Eric Clapton's career.

The song is a typical Clapton-style slow blues, still his sweet Strat overload sound, in particular, the most touching me is the deep confession of blues in the lyrics:

>"You don’t know how much it means,
 To have the music in me"
"I gotta have it,
 I gotta have this blues,
 I gotta have it”

For decades, Eric has been loyal to his favorite blues music while experimenting with different musical styles. Looking at the recent visit to Eric, he said that he did not say that he is ready to retire, but does not rule out this possibility.

The following is a snippet from the Spiral MV to find the classic moment of Eric Clapton's musical career as a reminiscence of his 50-year career with a small EC powder.
