On September, I left my hometown and went to a coastal city to enroll at university.
Everything is new, new environment, new classmates, new goals. . . 
The university was perplexed at first.
I wanted to participate in more student activities and wanted to focus on a goal.
To apply for a postgraduate program 4 years later? Maybe.

What kind of place is the university? 
I very much agree with Mr. Chen Yinque's words, "The spirit of freedom, the idea of ​​independence." 
At the university, choose your favorite class, participate in your favorite activities …...
To gradually form one's own personality and worldview, each person's thoughts should be open and free.
Those should not be forced to accept the influence of the thoughts of ideological and political education. 
Also, in the spare time, to slowly think and summarize: different levels, different stages, and different levels, each has different goals and standards

My high-school classmates have far-reaching top schools such as Stanford and Berkeley in the United States. 
There are also some more general colleges and universities。
We are different, and how to walk with our own goals and wills?

"Man's dearest possession is life. It is given to him but once, and he must live it so as to feel no torturing regrets for wasted years, never know the burning shame of a mean and petty past; so live that, dying, he might say: all my life, all my strength were given to the finest cause in all the world──the fight for the Liberation of Mankind"

― Nikolai Ostrovsky
