### Music

This is a sad song from Led Zeppelin's album "Led Zeppelin."
There is no place in the sound of Page's guitar and Plant that does not reveal the sorrow of parting.
With the intensive decomposition of the guitar, the lead singer has already revealed a great desperation. The addition of bass and drums in the middle of the song is an explosion in silence, but everything is gone in silence and madness.

### Lyrics

I have two understandings about lyrics.

One is more obvious, the boy is about to leave the girl, but this is what he does not want.
The other is a darker understanding: in the song, the lyrics mean that the man left not only the girl but a place:

> "But I got to go away from this place..."

He didn't really want to leave her, but to leave a place, and he kept mentioning "home." Home is a very common metaphor for heaven.

The lyrics said:

>"It feels good to have you back again,
And I know that one day, baby,
it's gonna really grow, yes it is.
We gonna go walkin' through the park every day."

Yes, they will eventually be together, they will be together in heaven.

According to this explanation, the man is going to commit suicide.
