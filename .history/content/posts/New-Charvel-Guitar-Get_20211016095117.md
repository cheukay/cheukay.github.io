Recently I was immersed in various metal music.
The traditional Fender strat can't satisfy me.
I am going to buy a new guitar for metal!
But I like the one with a strat headstock.
!!!
There is a brand called Charvel, which is dedicated to Superstrat
A few days ago, Tomlee Music had a special offer.
Seven percent off bought this Superstrat
I have the first Superstrat!
