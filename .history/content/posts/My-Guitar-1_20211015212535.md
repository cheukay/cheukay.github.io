I visited Tomlee Music last month. As I picked up the guitar and suddenly found that I have almost forgotten how to play it. Then I realized that, I have not practiced it for half a year since I arrived in Hong Kong. Here, I want to show my previous guitars.

## Electric guitars
### First electric guitar

![Original Squier 0912 Stratocaster](sq1.jpg)

My first electric guitar was an Squier model 0912 Stratocaster, which was so popular for beginners who wants a Fender Stracocater but can't afford it. 
At that time, I was a huge fan of Eric Clapton, so I chose a Squier Stratocaster with black finish, pretending that I had a 'Blackie'.

Then, I painted my 'Blackie' Squier.

### First Fender guitar

This is my first Fender Telecaster made in Mexico.
I bought it in Tomlee Music.

### More Fender!

This is my Fender Stratocaster made in Japan.
It is a second hand guitar, but it is good condition.
One thing I don't like is the noise came out of the vintage single-coil pickup.
So later I change those 3 pickup with a set of Fender N3 Noisless pickup.
