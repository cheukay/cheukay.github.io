How time flies!
I can't think of it as soon as I enter the junior year.
This year should be the most embarrassing because all kinds of destinations after the university depend on this school year. 
Even if the direction of finding a job after graduation from the university has already been rejected, it can be said that it is stressful in the face of continuing study.
I think, if my GPA is not so good enough now, the only option is to go to HK for MSc study. 
MSc in HK has the meaning of saying "buying a degree" in recent years.
However, the GPA, which has been ranked second in the past two years, has given me a lot of confidence. 
I can continue to fight for a year to compete for research and study, and I can also seek education abroad.
At the same time, the trouble is, of course, that the more choices, the more entangled.

Looking back at the university life of the previous two years, it can be said that it is rather boring.
 I always feel that I have not achieved anything in the two years. 
It may be that I personally compare utilitarianism. 
I thought that having a good grade can bring me a little glory, but it seems that no one will pay attention to me.

After my freshman year, I quit the student union and joined the guitar association. Thank you, friends, in the Band Society.
I also began to regain my music pursuit, and I am hooked on blues. 

A person, of course, there is a lot of loneliness, there are also many unsatisfactory things.

I will often be very depressed, but I don't like to say to others, I can use my guitar to say it, so it is a big sensation to play blues.
